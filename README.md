# ChadFairlie_ST10269509_PROG6221_POE

## Project Description

This project is a command-line application developed in C# and Visual Studio. It's designed to help users create, store, and manage recipes. The application allows users to enter and store the ingredients and steps for a recipe. It also provides functionality to scale the recipe by a factor of 0.5 (half), 2 (double), or 3 (triple), reset the recipe scale to the original values, and clear all the data to enter a new recipe. The data is stored in memory while the software is running and does not persist between runs.

## How to Compile and Run the Software

If you have no prior experience with coding, don't worry! Just follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. First, you need to install Visual Studio. You can download it from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Choose the Community version, which is free for individual developers, open source projects, academic research, education, and small professional teams.

2. Once you have Visual Studio installed, go to the GitHub repository page for this project. You can find it [here](https://github.com/AlphaSweater/ChadFairlie_ST10269509_PROG6221_POE).

3. On the GitHub repository page, click the green "Code" button and then click "Download ZIP".

4. Once the ZIP file is downloaded, extract it to a location of your choice on your computer.

5. Open Visual Studio and click on "Open a project or solution".

6. Navigate to the location where you extracted the ZIP file, go into the "ChadFairlie_ST10269509_PROG6221_POE-master" folder, and select the .sln file. Click "Open".

7. Once the project is open in Visual Studio, you can compile it by clicking on "Build" in the menu at the top, and then "Build Solution".

8. After the project has been compiled, you can run it by clicking on "Start" in the menu at the top, and then it should start up.

And that's it! You should now see the command-line interface of the application in a new window, ready for you to start entering and managing your recipes.
